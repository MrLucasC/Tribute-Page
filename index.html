    <p class="p1">Who is Albert Einstein?</p>

    <p class="p2">Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a world-renowned German theoretical physicist, best known for his theory of special relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of time and space. He also made major contributions to quantum physics and received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.
Einstein’s work had a deep impact not only on science but also on society. He was a committed humanist, a strong advocate for peace, civil rights, and freedom of expression. He spent the later years of his life in the United States, working at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.
Today, his name is synonymous with genius, and his legacy continues to inspire scientists and thinkers all over the world.</p>
